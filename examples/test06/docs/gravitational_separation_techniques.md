# Gravitational Separation Techniques

Gravitational separation techniques utilize the force of gravity to separate materials based on differences in density or particle size. Here are some common techniques:

1. Sedimentation
   - Used in water treatment plants
   - Separates suspended particles from liquids

2. Centrifugation
   - Enhances gravitational force using centrifugal acceleration
   - Used in laboratory and industrial settings

3. Cyclone Separation
   - Utilizes both gravity and centrifugal force
   - Commonly used in dust collection systems

4. Flotation
   - Separates materials based on their ability to float or sink
   - Used in mineral processing and wastewater treatment

5. Elutriation
   - Separates particles using an upward flowing gas or liquid
   - Applied in powder technology and mineral processing

6. Gravity Settling Tanks
   - Used in oil-water separation in the petroleum industry
   - Allows heavier components to settle at the bottom

7. Hydrocyclones
   - Combines centrifugal force and gravity
   - Used in mining and petroleum industries for solid-liquid separation

8. Density Gradient Centrifugation
   - Used in biochemistry to separate cellular components
   - Utilizes a density gradient medium

These techniques play crucial roles in various industries, including environmental engineering, biotechnology, and materials processing.
