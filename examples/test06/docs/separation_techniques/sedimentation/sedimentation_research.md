# Sedimentation: In-Depth Research

## Introduction
Sedimentation is a gravitational separation technique that separates suspended particles from a fluid based on the particles' size, shape, and density. This process occurs naturally in various environments and is widely applied in industrial and environmental contexts.

## Principles of Sedimentation
1. Stokes' Law
2. Terminal settling velocity
3. Particle size and density effects
4. Fluid viscosity and density influences

## Types of Sedimentation
1. Discrete particle sedimentation
2. Flocculent sedimentation
3. Zone sedimentation
4. Compression sedimentation
