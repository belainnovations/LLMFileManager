# Integration Test Design for LLMFileManager

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the design for integration tests of the LLMFileManager project, focusing on testing the interactions between different components of the system.

## 2. Test Scenarios
1. Clipboard to File Operation
2. Instruction Parsing to Execution
3. Error Handling Across Components

## 3. Test Implementation
### 3.1 Clipboard to File Operation
- Test file: `test_clipboard_to_file_operation.py`
- Objective: Verify that clipboard content is correctly processed and results in the expected file operation.

### 3.2 Instruction Parsing to Execution
- Test file: `test_instruction_parsing_to_execution.py`
- Objective: Ensure that parsed instructions are correctly executed by the FileOperator.

### 3.3 Error Handling Across Components
- Test file: `test_error_handling_across_components.py`
- Objective: Validate that errors are properly propagated and handled across different components.

## 4. Test Environment Setup
- Use pytest for running integration tests
- Mock external dependencies as necessary
- Ensure test isolation to prevent interference between tests

## 5. Execution Plan
1. Implement test scenarios in their respective files
2. Update `run_all_tests.py` to include integration tests
3. Run tests and generate comprehensive test reports

## 6. Reporting
- Include integration test results in the existing test report format
- Highlight any integration-specific issues or observations
