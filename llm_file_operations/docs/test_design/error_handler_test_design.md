# Detailed Test Design for error_handler.py

## 1. Component Analysis
The ErrorHandler class in error_handler.py is responsible for handling and logging errors in the LLM File Operations system. It contains two main methods:
- `handle(exception)`: Logs the error and prints a message to the console.
- `handle_error(message)`: Logs an error message and returns a formatted error string.

## 2. Test Case Identification
We will design test cases to cover the following aspects:

### 2.1 Initialization
- Test the initialization of the ErrorHandler class.

### 2.2 Error Handling
- Test the `handle` method with various types of exceptions.
- Verify that errors are correctly logged.
- Ensure the correct console output is generated.

### 2.3 Error Message Formatting
- Test the `handle_error` method with different error messages.
- Verify the correct formatting of returned error strings.

### 2.4 Logging Interaction
- Verify that the correct logging level (ERROR) is used.
- Ensure that both the exception message and traceback are logged.

## 3. Test Cases

### 3.1 Initialization Tests
1. Test ErrorHandler initialization

### 3.2 Error Handling Tests
2. Test handle method with a standard Exception
3. Test handle method with a custom Exception
4. Test handle method with a system Exception (e.g., FileNotFoundError)

### 3.3 Error Message Formatting Tests
5. Test handle_error method with a simple string message
6. Test handle_error method with a multi-line error message
7. Test handle_error method with a message containing special characters

### 3.4 Logging Interaction Tests
8. Test that errors are logged at the ERROR level
9. Test that both exception message and traceback are logged
10. Test logging behavior when logger is configured at different levels

## 4. Mocking Strategy
- We will use the `unittest.mock` module to mock the `logging` module.
- This allows us to verify logging calls without actually writing to log files.

## 5. Code Coverage
- Aim for 100% code coverage for the ErrorHandler class.
- Use coverage tools to identify any missed code paths.

## 6. Integration Considerations
- Verify that ErrorHandler integrates correctly with other components that use it (e.g., FileOperator).
- Ensure that error messages are propagated correctly through the system.

## 7. Implementation Plan
1. Set up the test file structure
2. Implement initialization tests
3. Implement error handling tests
4. Implement error message formatting tests
5. Implement logging interaction tests
6. Run tests and verify coverage
7. Refine tests as needed to achieve full coverage
8. Document any assumptions or limitations in the test suite
