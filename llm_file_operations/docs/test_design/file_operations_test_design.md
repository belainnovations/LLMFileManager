# Detailed Test Design for file_operations.py

## 1. Component Analysis
The FileOperator class in file_operations.py is responsible for executing file and folder operations based on instructions. It interacts with the file system, ContextMatcher, and ErrorHandler.

Key methods include:
- `execute(instruction)`: Main method for executing file operations
- `create_file(file_path, content)`
- `create_folder(folder_path)`
- `delete_file(file_path)`
- `delete_folder(folder_path)`
- `modify_file(file_path, action, instruction)`

## 2. Test Case Identification
We will design test cases to cover the following aspects:

### 2.1 Initialization
- Test the initialization of the FileOperator class with mocked dependencies.

### 2.2 File Operations
- Test each file operation method (create, delete, modify) for both success and failure scenarios.
- Verify correct handling of different file types and extensions.
- Test operations with various file paths (relative, absolute, nested).

### 2.3 Instruction Execution
- Test the `execute` method with different types of instructions.
- Verify correct delegation to specific operation methods.

### 2.4 Error Handling
- Test error scenarios such as file not found, permission errors, etc.
- Verify correct interaction with the ErrorHandler.

### 2.5 Context Matching
- Test the interaction with ContextMatcher for file modifications.

## 3. Test Cases

### 3.1 Initialization Tests
1. Test FileOperator initialization with mocked dependencies

### 3.2 File Operation Tests
2. Test create_file with valid path and content
3. Test create_file with existing file (should overwrite)
4. Test create_folder with valid path
5. Test create_folder with existing folder
6. Test delete_file with existing file
7. Test delete_file with non-existent file
8. Test delete_folder with existing folder
9. Test delete_folder with non-existent folder
10. Test modify_file with REPLACE action
11. Test modify_file with INSERT action
12. Test modify_file with DELETE action

### 3.3 Instruction Execution Tests
13. Test execute method with CREATE_FILE instruction
14. Test execute method with CREATE_FOLDER instruction
15. Test execute method with DELETE_FILE instruction
16. Test execute method with DELETE_FOLDER instruction
17. Test execute method with REPLACE instruction
18. Test execute method with INSERT instruction
19. Test execute method with DELETE instruction
20. Test execute method with invalid action

### 3.4 Error Handling Tests
21. Test file size limit enforcement
22. Test allowed file extensions enforcement
23. Test handling of permission errors
24. Test handling of disk full scenario

### 3.5 Context Matching Tests
25. Test modify_file with valid start and end contexts
26. Test modify_file with invalid start context
27. Test modify_file with invalid end context

## 4. Mocking Strategy
- Mock the file system operations using `unittest.mock` or a library like `pyfakefs`.
- Mock ContextMatcher and ErrorHandler to isolate FileOperator testing.
- Use mock configurations to simulate various file system states and errors.

## 5. Code Coverage
- Aim for 100% code coverage for the FileOperator class.
- Use coverage tools to identify any missed code paths, especially in error handling branches.

## 6. Integration Considerations
- Verify correct interaction with ContextMatcher for file modifications.
- Ensure proper use of ErrorHandler for all error scenarios.
- Test with a variety of instruction formats to ensure compatibility with InstructionParser output.

## 7. Implementation Plan
1. Set up the test file structure and import necessary modules
2. Implement initialization tests
3. Implement file operation tests
4. Implement instruction execution tests
5. Implement error handling tests
6. Implement context matching tests
7. Run tests and verify coverage
8. Refine tests as needed to achieve full coverage
9. Document any assumptions or limitations in the test suite
