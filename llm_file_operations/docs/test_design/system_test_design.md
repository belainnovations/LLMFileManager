# System Test Design for LLMFileManager

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the design for system tests of the LLMFileManager project, focusing on end-to-end scenarios that validate the entire system's functionality.

## 2. Test Scenarios
1. Complete Workflow Test
2. Error Handling and Recovery Test
3. Performance and Load Test
4. Configuration Validation Test

## 3. Test Implementation
### 3.1 Complete Workflow Test
- Objective: Verify the entire process from clipboard monitoring to file operation execution.
- Key steps:
  1. Simulate clipboard content changes
  2. Monitor instruction parsing
  3. Validate file operations execution
  4. Verify final file system state

### 3.2 Error Handling and Recovery Test
- Objective: Ensure the system can handle and recover from various error conditions.
- Key areas to test:
  1. Invalid instructions
  2. File system errors (e.g., permissions, disk full)
  3. Unexpected interruptions

### 3.3 Performance and Load Test
- Objective: Assess system performance under various load conditions.
- Aspects to test:
  1. Response time for different file sizes
  2. Handling of multiple rapid instructions
  3. System resource utilization

### 3.4 Configuration Validation Test
- Objective: Verify that the system respects all configuration settings.
- Key points:
  1. Test with different config.yaml settings
  2. Validate adherence to file size limits, allowed extensions, etc.

## 4. Test Environment Setup
- Use a dedicated test environment that mimics the production setup
- Prepare test data sets for various scenarios
- Implement mechanisms to simulate different system conditions (e.g., low disk space)

## 5. Execution Plan
1. Develop test scripts for each scenario
2. Create a test data generator for consistent and varied inputs
3. Implement a system test runner that orchestrates the entire test suite
4. Establish clear pass/fail criteria for each test case

## 6. Reporting
- Generate comprehensive reports detailing:
  1. Test scenario outcomes
  2. Performance metrics
  3. Any encountered errors or unexpected behaviors
- Include system state snapshots before and after each test run
