# Dependency Consistency Report

## Overview
This report compares the dependencies listed in `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, and the actual imports used in the source files.

## setup.py Dependencies
- pyperclip
- pyyaml

## requirements.txt Dependencies
- pyperclip
- pyyaml

## Imports in Source Files
- clipboard_monitor.py: pyperclip, time, logging, binascii
- context_matcher.py: logging
- error_handler.py: logging, traceback
- file_operations.py: os, logging
- instruction_parser.py: logging, yaml, re
- main.py: os, logging

## Analysis
1. The dependencies listed in `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` are consistent.
2. All external dependencies (pyperclip, pyyaml) are correctly listed in both files.
3. Standard library imports (os, logging, time, re, traceback, binascii) are correctly not listed in the dependency files.

## Conclusion
The project maintains consistency in its dependency management. All necessary external libraries are properly declared in both `setup.py` and `requirements.txt`. No discrepancies or missing dependencies were found.

## Recommendation
The current setup is correct and no changes are needed. Continue to maintain this consistency as the project evolves.
