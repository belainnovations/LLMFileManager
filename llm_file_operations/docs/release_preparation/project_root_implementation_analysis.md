# Project Root Implementation Analysis

## Config File (config.yaml)
The config file correctly specifies the project_root:
```yaml
project_root: "docs"
```

## Main Script (main.py)
The main script loads the configuration correctly:
```python
config = load_config()
```
And passes it to the FileOperator:
```python
file_operator = FileOperator(context_matcher, error_handler, config)
```

## File Operations (file_operations.py)
The FileOperator class receives the config in its constructor:
```python
def __init__(self, context_matcher, error_handler, config):
    self.config = config
```

However, the execute method does not use the project_root setting when performing file operations:
```python
def execute(self, instruction):
    file_path = instruction.get('file')
    # File operations are performed directly on file_path without considering project_root
```

## Conclusion
The project_root setting is correctly defined in the config and passed to the FileOperator, but it's not being used when performing file operations. This explains why files are still being created in the project root instead of the specified "docs" directory.

## Recommendation
Update the FileOperator class to use the project_root setting. In the execute method, modify the file_path to be relative to the project_root:

```python
def execute(self, instruction):
    relative_path = instruction.get('file')
    project_root = self.config.get('project_root', '.')
    file_path = os.path.join(project_root, relative_path)
    # Use file_path for all file operations
```

This change will ensure that all file operations are performed relative to the specified project_root directory.
