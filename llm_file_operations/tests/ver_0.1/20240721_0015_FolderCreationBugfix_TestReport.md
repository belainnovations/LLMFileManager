# Folder Creation Bugfix Test Report

## Issue Description
During the creation of the LLM interface subfolder, it was discovered that the file extension restriction was incorrectly applied to folder creation operations.

## Resolution
The `execute` method in `file_operations.py` was modified to skip the extension check for CREATE_FOLDER and DELETE_FOLDER operations.

## Test Results
After applying the fix:
- Successfully created the `llm_file_operations/tests/llm_interface` folder
- Verified that the extension check is bypassed for folder operations
- Confirmed that file operations still respect the extension restrictions

## Conclusion
The bugfix successfully resolved the issue, allowing folder creation without being restricted by the allowed file extensions list while maintaining the intended behavior for file operations.
