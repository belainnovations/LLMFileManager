# LLM File Operations Test Plan

## 1. Test Suite Structure

- Create a main test runner script: `run_tests.py`
- Organize test cases into separate files:
  - `test_file_operations.py`
  - `test_clipboard_monitor.py`
  - `test_instruction_parser.py`
  - `test_context_matcher.py`
  - `test_error_handler.py`

## 2. Test Case Implementation

- Use Python's unittest framework
- Implement setUp and tearDown methods for common tasks
- Use mock objects to simulate various scenarios
- Create fixtures for complex test data

## 3. Test Categories

### 3.1 Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and methods
- Focus on edge cases and error handling

### 3.2 Integration Tests
- Test interactions between different components
- Verify correct data flow and processing

### 3.3 Configuration Tests
- Test different configuration settings
- Verify system behavior with various config options

### 3.4 Performance Tests
- Test system performance with large files
- Measure execution time for critical operations

## 4. Continuous Integration

- Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Run tests on each push and pull request

## 5. Test Execution

To run all tests, execute the following command from the project root:

```
python -m unittest discover -v -s tests
```

This command will automatically discover and run all test cases in the tests directory.

## 6. Reporting

- Generate test reports after each run
- Include test coverage information
- Store reports in the `tests/ver_0.1/reports` directory

## 7. Maintenance

- Regularly review and update test cases
- Add new tests for bug fixes and feature additions
- Refactor tests as needed to improve maintainability
