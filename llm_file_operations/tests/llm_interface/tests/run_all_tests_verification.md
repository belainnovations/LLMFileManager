# Verification Report: run_all_tests.py

## Overview
This report analyzes the coherence between the intended functionality and the actual implementation in run_all_tests.py.

## Functionality Analysis

1. Test Discovery and Execution
   - Intended Functionality: Discover and run all tests in the project
   - Implementation: Uses pytest.main() to run tests
   - Coherence: Match

2. Working Directory Setup
   - Intended Functionality: Ensure tests are run from the correct project root
   - Implementation: Changes the working directory to the project root
   - Coherence: Match

3. Test Output
   - Intended Functionality: Provide detailed test results
   - Implementation: Uses verbose mode (-v) and short traceback (--tb=short)
   - Coherence: Match

## Conclusion
The run_all_tests.py script demonstrates strong coherence with its intended functionality. It effectively sets up the correct working environment, discovers tests, and executes them with appropriate output settings.

The script serves its purpose as a centralized test runner for the project, ensuring consistent test execution across the entire codebase.

Recommendations:
1. Consider adding command-line arguments to allow for more flexible test execution (e.g., running specific test modules or classes).
2. Implement a mechanism to generate and save test reports for better tracking of test results over time.
3. Add error handling to provide more informative output in case of test discovery or execution failures.

These enhancements would further improve the utility and robustness of the test runner script.
