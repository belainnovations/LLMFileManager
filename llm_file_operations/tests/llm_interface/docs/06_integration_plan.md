# LLM Interface: Integration Plan with Main Project

## 1. Code Structure Alignment
- Ensure LLM interface follows the same coding standards as the main project
- Align folder structure with the main project for consistency

## 2. Dependency Management
- Update main project's requirements.txt to include LLM interface dependencies
- Ensure version compatibility across all shared libraries

## 3. Configuration Integration
- Extend main project's config.yaml to include LLM-specific settings
- Implement a unified configuration loading mechanism

## 4. API Abstraction Layer
- Create a facade in the main project to interact with LLM interface
- Implement adapter pattern for seamless integration

## 5. Error Handling and Logging
- Extend main project's error handling to cover LLM-specific errors
- Integrate LLM interface logging with the main project's logging system

## 6. Testing Framework Integration
- Extend main project's test suite to include LLM interface tests
- Implement integration tests that cover the interaction between main project and LLM interface

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline Updates
- Update CI/CD workflows to include LLM interface in build and test processes
- Implement automated deployment for LLM interface alongside main project

## 8. Documentation Updates
- Update main project's documentation to include LLM interface usage
- Create API reference for LLM interface in the main project's docs

## 9. Performance Optimization
- Profile combined system performance
- Optimize data flow between main project and LLM interface

## 10. Security Review
- Conduct a security audit of the integrated system
- Ensure consistent application of security protocols across both components

## 11. Version Control Strategy
- Determine whether to keep LLM interface in a separate repository or integrate into main project
- Establish branching and merging strategies for ongoing development

## 12. Rollout Plan
- Develop a phased rollout plan for integrating LLM interface into production
- Create rollback procedures in case of integration issues

This integration plan ensures a smooth incorporation of the LLM interface into the main LLM File Operations project, maintaining consistency in code structure, configuration, error handling, and testing practices.
