# LLM Interface: Security and Data Handling Protocols

## 1. API Key Management
- Store API keys in environment variables or secure configuration files
- Use key rotation practices for enhanced security
- Implement encryption for stored keys

## 2. Data Encryption
- Use industry-standard encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Implement TLS for all network communications

## 3. Input Sanitization
- Sanitize all user inputs before processing
- Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks

## 4. Output Handling
- Sanitize LLM outputs before use in file operations
- Implement strict parsing and validation of generated LLMOP commands

## 5. Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use token bucket algorithm for flexible rate control

## 6. Logging and Monitoring
- Implement secure logging practices
- Set up monitoring for unusual activity or potential security breaches

## 7. Error Handling
- Implement graceful error handling to prevent information leakage
- Use generic error messages for user-facing outputs

## 8. Access Control
- Implement role-based access control for different parts of the system
- Use principle of least privilege for all operations

## 9. Dependency Management
- Regularly update and patch all dependencies
- Use a dependency scanning tool to check for known vulnerabilities

## 10. Compliance
- Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)
- Implement data retention and deletion policies

## 11. Security Testing
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing
- Implement automated security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline
