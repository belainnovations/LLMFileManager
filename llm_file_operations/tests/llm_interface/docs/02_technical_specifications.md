# LLM Interface: Technical Specifications

## 1. Architecture
- Modular design with separate modules for API interactions, context handling, and LLMOP command processing
- Abstraction layer to support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude)

## 2. API Integration
### 2.1 OpenAI GPT
- Implement wrapper for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models
- Handle authentication, request formatting, and response parsing

### 2.2 Anthropic Claude
- Develop integration for Claude API
- Implement Claude-specific request structures and response handling

## 3. Context Window Management
- Implement dynamic context window sizing based on model capabilities
- Develop efficient token counting and context truncation mechanisms

## 4. LLMOP Command Generation
- Create prompt templates for generating valid LLMOP commands
- Implement validation logic for generated commands

## 5. Caching System
- Design an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache for storing recent API responses
- Implement cache invalidation strategies

## 6. Error Handling and Logging
- Develop comprehensive error handling for API failures, rate limits, and invalid responses
- Implement detailed logging system compatible with main project's logging framework

## 7. Security Measures
- Secure storage and handling of API keys
- Implement encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest

## 8. Performance Optimization
- Asynchronous API calls for improved throughput
- Implement request batching for multiple operations

## 9. Testing Framework
- Unit tests for individual components (API wrappers, context handlers, etc.)
- Integration tests simulating full LLMOP command generation workflow
- Performance benchmarks for different LLM providers and models

## 10. Main Project Integration
- Develop interface methods for seamless integration with LLM File Operations testing framework
- Ensure compatibility with existing project structure and coding standards
