# Project Nexus: Testing Framework and Strategy

## Testing Framework Decision

For Project Nexus, we will use pytest as our primary testing framework. Pytest offers several advantages:

1. Simple syntax and easy-to-write tests
2. Powerful fixture system for managing test dependencies
3. Extensive plugin ecosystem
4. Built-in support for parameterized testing
5. Compatibility with existing unittest-based tests

## Testing Strategy

We will implement a comprehensive testing strategy that includes:

1. Unit Tests
2. Integration Tests
3. System Tests

### Unit Tests

- Create test files alongside source files (e.g., test_api_providers.py next to api_providers.py)
- Use pytest fixtures to mock external dependencies (e.g., Anthropic API)
- Aim for high code coverage (target: 90%+)
- Implement parameterized tests for edge cases

### Integration Tests

- Test interactions between different components (e.g., AnthropicProvider and LLMOPCommandGenerator)
- Use pytest-mock to simulate complex scenarios
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical workflows

### System Tests

- Create tests that simulate real-world usage of Project Nexus
- Integrate with the main LLM File Operations system for full functionality testing
- Use pytest-bdd for behavior-driven development if complex scenarios arise

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

We will follow a TDD approach:

1. Write a failing test for the desired functionality
2. Implement the minimum code to pass the test
3. Refactor the code while ensuring tests continue to pass
4. Repeat for each new feature or component

## Continuous Integration

- Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing on each push and pull request
- Implement pre-commit hooks for code formatting and linting

By following this testing framework and strategy, we ensure high-quality code, catch bugs early, and maintain confidence in our implementation as Project Nexus grows and evolves.
