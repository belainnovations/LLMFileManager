# LLM Interface Development Plan

## 1. Project Structure
- Create `llm_interface.py` as the main interface file
- Implement `config.yaml` for API keys and other settings

## 2. Core Functionality
- Develop a wrapper function for LLM API calls
- Implement context window handling (input/output)
- Create error handling and logging mechanisms

## 3. API Integration
- Start with OpenAI's GPT API integration
- Plan for easy addition of other LLM APIs in the future

## 4. Testing Framework
- Develop unit tests for the LLM interface
- Create integration tests with the main LLM File Operations tool

## 5. Documentation
- Write usage instructions and API documentation
- Include example scripts for common use cases

## 6. Performance Optimization
- Implement caching mechanisms for repeated queries
- Optimize context window management for efficiency

## 7. Security Considerations
- Implement secure handling of API keys
- Ensure proper error handling to prevent data leaks

## 8. Integration with Main Project
- Develop methods to use LLM interface in LLMOP command generation
- Create test cases for LLMOP command format validation

This plan provides a foundation for the LLM interface development, which we can refine and expand upon as we progress through the implementation.
