# LLM Interface Sub-Project: Overview and Goals

## Project Purpose
The LLM Interface sub-project aims to develop a robust and flexible interface for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) within the context of the LLM File Operations tool. This interface will enable programmatic testing of LLM prompts and their effectiveness in generating valid LLMOP commands.

## Key Objectives
1. Create a modular and extensible LLM API wrapper
2. Implement efficient context window handling
3. Ensure secure management of API keys and sensitive data
4. Develop a comprehensive testing framework for LLM interactions
5. Seamlessly integrate with the main LLM File Operations project

## Scope
- Initial focus on OpenAI's GPT API, with architecture supporting future LLM integrations
- Development of core API interaction functionalities
- Implementation of caching and optimization mechanisms
- Creation of unit and integration tests
- Documentation of usage and integration guidelines

## Success Criteria
- Successful generation and validation of LLMOP commands through LLM interactions
- Efficient handling of context windows and API rate limits
- Comprehensive test coverage of LLM interface functionalities
- Seamless integration with the main LLM File Operations testing framework

## Alignment with Main Project
This sub-project directly supports the testing and validation efforts of the LLM File Operations tool, ensuring that LLM-generated commands adhere to the required LLMOP format and functionality.
