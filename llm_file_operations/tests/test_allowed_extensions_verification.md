# Verification Report: test_allowed_extensions.py

## Overview
This report analyzes the coherence between the property being tested and the actual test in test_allowed_extensions.py.

## Test Case Analysis

1. test_allowed_extensions
   - Property: Enforcement of allowed file extensions for file operations
   - Test: Verifies that operations are allowed on files with permitted extensions and disallowed on files with restricted extensions
   - Coherence: Strong Match

## Conclusion
The test in test_allowed_extensions.py demonstrates excellent coherence with the property it is designed to verify. It effectively checks the functionality of the file extension validation in the FileOperator class.

Key aspects of the test:
1. Creates temporary files with both allowed (.txt) and disallowed (.exe) extensions
2. Attempts operations on both types of files
3. Verifies that operations succeed on allowed extensions and fail on disallowed ones

This comprehensive approach ensures that the file extension validation mechanism works as intended for both positive and negative scenarios.

Recommendations:
1. Consider testing with multiple allowed and disallowed extensions to ensure broader coverage
2. Add a test case for files without extensions to verify how the system handles them
3. Include a test for files with multiple extensions (e.g., file.tar.gz) to ensure correct handling

These additions would further enhance the robustness of the test suite for the allowed extensions feature.
